## Resume

My <a href='https://jeffchiou.github.io/resume/'>resume</a> is on Github pages. It currently uses HTML and CSS, with the help of <a href='https://augmented-ui.com/'>augmented-ui</a>.

## Portfolio


### CoordiScroll


As demonstrated on the widescreen view of this website, [CoordiScroll](https://jeffchiou.github.io/coordiscroll/) is a javascript utility that synchronizes scrolling across elements. It uses a publish-subscribe architecture for maximum flexibility. An extension version is on the backburner.

### This Website

I consider writing part of my portfolio. Please take a look at my articles and blog posts.

See the [About page](/about#tech) for technical details about my website. Previously my website was created with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), but I have since switched to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/).

### Other Projects

Please see my [github](https://github.com/jeffchiou/) for more projects and gists.
