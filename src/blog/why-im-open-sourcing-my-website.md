title: Why I'm Open-Sourcing My Website!

I've open sourced this website! I was a little anxious about doing so because it exposes all the bumps and imperfections. Here are the reasons why I did it:

## 1. Learning in Public

Open-sourcing is one form of learning in public (another being blogging). As a concept, learning in public deserves its own blog post, but I'll just list a few benefits as applied to open-sourcing the website.

- I'd like to improve my work, and open-sourcing it increases the chance that someone provides useful feedback.
- Learning in public results in a larger body of work that can open up opportunities and that one can point to as reference. 
- Maybe someone will find a use for my code.
- Helps me practice *being* in public, as well as expressing myself.

## 2. Lightweight Commenting System

My site already has enough of a footprint, so I didn't want to add more by introducing a heavy commenting like Disqus. Instead, I found [utterances](https://utteranc.es/), created by [Jeremy Danyow](https://danyow.net/using-github-issues-for-blog-comments/). It's a lightweight commenting app that hooks into your github repository, and only works if your repository is public!

## 3. Exposure Therapy

After years of mental health struggles, I've finally found therapy systems that work for me long term, and that I can continue maintaining on my own. These are [ACT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy), [DBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy), and [CBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy). By exposing my work and thoughts to the world, I am practicing some of my values (ex action, courage, completion) ala ACT, attenuating anxiety ala CBT, and regulating emotion ala DBT.
