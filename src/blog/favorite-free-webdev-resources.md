These are my favorite free web development resources that I actually used, excluding any official documentation and the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

## Courses

- [Full Stack Open Course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) by the University of Helsinki
  - Probably the best React-based full-stack course. Is up-to-date (as of 2019) and uses modern syntax.
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)
  - Go from zero to hero - curates free resources into a comprehensive course.
  - This mostly solves the issue of finding high-quality resources in the noise of the modern internet, reducing decision fatigue.
- [Scrimba’s Learn React](https://scrimba.com/g/glearnreact)
  - Great, shorter React-only course, despite not being as up-to-date. There is a [new course](https://scrimba.com/g/greact) by the same instructor, but I haven’t tried it. 
  - Scrimba’s an engaging platform overall, with several other nice courses available.

## Short Tutorials

- Codepip’s mini-games, namely [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/).
- In a similar vein, [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) by flukeout is great for learning CSS selectors.
- [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
  - Git is part of the modern web development workflow. This is a comprehensive and accessible tutorial for a complex topic.

## References

- [Javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)
  - Can also count as a course. Clearly explained concepts along with exercises and solutions.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
  - Great cheatsheets and guides for CSS

## Honorable mention

- EdX and Coursera - there are some great courses there if you have the time to commit, such as [HKU’s Front-End React Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/front-end-react) and [Harvard’s CS50 Web](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/).
- The [webdev subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/webdev/) - lots of lists and resources available there.
