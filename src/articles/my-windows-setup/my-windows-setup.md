title: "My Windows Setup: Starting From a Fresh Install"
datePosted: 2020-12-06

[toc]



Welcome to my Windows setup! Recently I reinstalled Windows on a higher-capacity Samsung SSD, removing the old one. Here I'll list the programs I install as well as the configuration steps I perform.

In general, before a major hardware change, I back up everything if possible. I put the old SSD in a Sabrent USB enclosure for convenient access to backed-up files.

I'm planning to update this article over the next few days, as I run into issues and remember more programs to install. 

## Installations

### First Programs

The first thing I install is [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/). Then I use Scoop to install almost everything else. Scoop doesn't automatically add things to the context menu, which I like since my context menu tends to get too cluttered. I add the items I want manually. 

To it easier to associate files with Scoop-installed programs, I saw that the "open with" context menu item points to `C:\Program Files`. I just added two shortcuts to the Program Files folder that I created on the desktop â€” the first to `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Scoop Apps` and the second to `C:\Users\mirum\scoop\apps`

Things that I can't find on Scoop, I use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). I've found that Chocolatey doesn't clean up as easily so I try not to install too many things with it.

### Scoop

I've categorized the programs I install with Scoop here in no particular order. The Scoop name for installing is next to the main software name. Note that git has to be installed before everything else.

## Windows Configuration

I like my taskbar to use small buttons and never combine, and for multiple monitors, show on main taskbar and taskbar where window is open. I turn off User Account Control (UAC).

I ran into a weird bug where I couldn't create new folders. For some reason,

`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Folder` in regedit had `(Default)` set as `pdf_auto_file`. I changed it to `Folder`, signed out and back in, and things worked again.

If necessary, I use [ShellMenuView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shell_menu_view.html) to edit the right-click context menu.

I boost my microphone and change headphone equalizer settings.

Optional features can be added with "Turn Windows features on or off." I add Windows Sandbox, Virtual Machine Platform, and [Windows Subsystem for Linux](#Windows Subsystem for Linux).

### Copy From Backup

I copy over everything from Dropbox from the old drive to save bandwidth. I copy over my folder of git repositories which takes longer than it should due to node_modules folders.

I copy wallpapers from my wallpaper folder to the default DesktopBackground folder (I get most of my wallpapers from [wallpaperhub.app](https://wallpaperhub.app))

I install various fonts as needed.

### Change Folders and Search Options

Show hidden files, folders, and drives.

Uncheck "hide extensions for known file types".

## Smaller Programs Configuration

For espanso, I copy over my default.yml file.

### Keypirinha

I configure Keypirinha to use alt+space and startup. I install [PackageControl](https://github.com/ueffel/Keypirinha-PackageControl) which contains packages from [ueffel's Package Repository](https://ue.spdns.de/packagecontrol/). These are the packages I install:

- [WindowsApps](https://github.com/ueffel/Keypirinha-WindowsApps)
- [winsys](https://github.com/kvnxiao/keypirinha-winsys)
- [cvt](https://github.com/DrorHarari/keypirinha-cvt)
- [currency](https://github.com/AvatarHurden/keypirinha-currency)
- [myip](https://github.com/Fuhrmann/keypirinha-myip)
- [Time](https://github.com/ueffel/Keypirinha-Time)
- [colorpicker](https://github.com/clinden/keypirinha-colorpicker)
- [terminal-profiles](https://github.com/fran-f/keypirinha-terminal-profiles)

Some plugins weren't working for me, including [Command](https://github.com/bantya/Keypirinha-Command) and [sharex](https://github.com/Fuhrmann/keypirinha-sharex).

### Everything

Start on startup, run as admin, install and use the everything service. I change the show window hotkey: CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+SPACE.

### 7-Zip

Associate with all formats and integrate into explorer shell (context menu).

### Zotero

Copy over the [user profile folder](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/profile_directory) at `C:\Users\<User Name>\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\<randomstring>`.

I store my Zotero storage folder in cloud storage. One should make a directory junction (as opposed to symlinks or hardlinks) to storage, since a junction will be valid even when viewed over the network from another computer while a symlink will not. Use `mklink /J storage TARGET_PATH`.[^mklink] 

I install the [BetterBibTex](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex) plugin. 

### Steam

I store some games in other drives. To re-add the libraries to Steam, go to Steam > Settings > Downloads > Steam Library Folders.

Also turn off start on boot using Steam > Settings > Interface.

## Firefox Configuration

I sync my settings, which installs most of my browser extensions. Regarding browser extensions, my essential ones are [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) and [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock). Here's how I configure a few others:

[Enhancer for YouTube](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/enhancer-for-youtube/)â€” speed up to 1.2x, control volume with mouse cursor, autoplay at higher quality. Note that it can be worth it to play at a higher quality than your monitor resolution due to compression.

[Tab Unloader for Tree Style Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-unload-for-tree-style-tab/) â€” tabs unloaded should be hidden from top and only shown in the sidebar. Unfortunately, I can't seem to get it working like it used to.

[Foxy Gestures](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxy-gestures/) - I customize my gestures to be more like old Opera.

## Hardware Configuration

### 144hz Display

Nvidia control panel â€” Enable for windowed and full screen mode.

For other settings I follow [Blur Buster's Optimal G-Sync Settings]( https://blurbusters.com/gsync/gsync101-input-lag-tests-and-settings/14/)

## Developer-Related Configuration

### Git Configuration

Open git bash and enter:

`git config --global user.name "First Last"`

`git config --global user.email "myemail@email.com"`

I copy over my old SSH keys as well.

### Python Configuration

Use pyenv-win from chocolatey and anaconda3 from scoop.

`pyenv update` 

`pyenv install --list`

`pyenv install 3.x.x`

`pyenv global 3.x.x`

#### Anaconda

Installed from scoop. Generate a new GUID using `New-Guid` command in powershell. Windows terminal configuration:

```json
{
    "guid": "{af025e50-575e-4298-b3bf-19aa00e1df57}",
    "name": "Anaconda Powershell",
    "commandline": "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -NoExit -Command & 'C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\scoop\\apps\\anaconda3\\current\\shell\\condabin\\conda-hook.ps1' ; conda activate 'C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\scoop\\apps\\anaconda3\\current\\envs\\general'",
    "hidden": false
},
```

You can customize it further.

#### Jupyter Lab

I install [ipyvolume](https://github.com/maartenbreddels/ipyvolume) and [ipympl](https://github.com/matplotlib/ipympl)

### NPM and Node

WIP

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

The installation guide is [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). Make sure you enable the two required optional features (oxymoron) using "Turn Windows features on or off" or the PowerShell commands in the guide.

[^nodejs]: Includes npm.
[^bandizip]: I used to use Peazip, but startup time was too slow.

[^bcu]: Too many chocolatey packages will slow this down.

[^lockhunter]: Non-portable, for the context menu item.

[^calibre]: `calibre-normal` is the non-portable version.
[^latex]: actually MikTeX
[^mpv.net]: Sometimes GUIs are nice, especially if you don't want to memorize all the keyboard shortcuts.
[^startup-delayer]: Dropbox and OneDrive interfere with the screen capture shortcuts that I want to give to ShareX, so I ensure ShareX starts first using Startup Delayer.
[^mklink]: Note that `mklink` exists in the command prompt but not PowerShell.
